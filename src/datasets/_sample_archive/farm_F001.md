## Active Farm Alerts for F001
1. `ALERT-F001-01` [CRITICAL]: **Severe Root-Zone Moisture Deficit** — Volumetric water content at 45cm fell below management threshold of 25% for 72 consecutive hours.
2. `ALERT-F001-02` [CRITICAL]: **Rapid Canopy Vigor Decline (NDVI Drop > 0.15)** — Satellite image analysis on Oct 04 indicates a 39% reduction in active green canopy reflectance across Block B and C.
3. `ALERT-F001-03` [WARNING]: **Atmospheric Vapor Deficit Elevation** — High daytime temperatures (34.2°C) coupled with 42% humidity increasing crop transpiration demand.

## Water & Nutrient Management Log
- **Last Irrigation Date**: Sept 29, 2026 (6 days ago)
- **Target Irrigation Volume**: 45,000 Liters / Acre / Week
- **Actual Delivered Volume (Last Week)**: 18,000 Liters / Acre (Clogged emitter lines suspected in Block B)
